# rwm-coding-challenge

Automated end-to-end testing project for a React + Node.js application, using Playwright for UI and API testing, Faker for test data generation, and GitHub Actions for CI.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **UI testing**: Login flows, create/edit/delete items, verify data.
- **API testing**: Interactions with endpoints (`POST /login`, `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /items/:id`), with positive and negative scenarios.
- Dynamic test data using Faker.
- Continuous integration pipelines via GitHub Actions.

---

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Git

---

## 📝 Note for reviewer:
For your convenience, the .env file is included in this repository to allow easier and faster test execution.

In a real production setup, sensitive environment variables should always be managed via GitHub Secrets or other secure secret management solutions.

✅ This project is already configured to use GitHub Secrets in CI workflows.

## 🧩 Dynamic Test Data
Faker is used to generate realistic test data — including names, emails, text, and more — making tests more robust and less brittle.
